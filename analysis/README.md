**Feature Extraction Pipeline**



This folder contains the Python scripts used for extracting features from the preprocessed acoustic signals generated by the SensEat system.



**Overview**



Given a clean, preprocessed time-domain signal (`s\_t`) and its corresponding frequency-domain representation (`s\_f`), this pipeline extracts four major groups of features:



**1. Time-Domain Statistical Features**



Computed directly from the raw clean signal:


Mean

Standard deviation

Variance

RMS amplitude

Max / Min amplitude

Peak-to-peak

Skewness

Kurtosis

Zero-Crossing Rate

Shannon entropy



**2. Frequency-Domain Statistical Features**



Computed from FFT of the signal:


FFT mean

FFT std

FFT max

Spectral centroid

Spectral bandwidth

Spectral roll-off (85%)

Spectral flatness



**3. MFCC Features**



Using `librosa`, we compute:



The first 13 MFCC coefficients, averaged across time frames.



**4. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)**



Using the Morlet wavelet (`morl`):



Energy values across 128 wavelet scales.



**5. STFT Features**



Using `scipy.signal.stft`:



STFT mean energy

STFT max energy

Peak energy frequency bin

Estimated bandwidth





**File: `feature\_extraction.py`**



This script loads a `.pcm` audio file, computes all feature groups, and prints the resulting feature dictionary.



**Usage**



```bash

python feature\_extraction.py

```



**Input File**



Update the script to point to your PCM file:



```python

pcm\_file = "test2.pcm"

```



**Output**



The script prints all extracted features in a dictionary-like format.
